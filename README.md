# The *Mission Impossible Travel Manager* app 

The app for those who have to manage little times.

### Tech Stack
- **React**: because this is what I'm currently studying;
- **TypeScript**: because a typed language is always a safest choice;
- **Tailwind**: because I'm currently studying it AND because I think it's way more versatile compared to Bootstrap;
- **json-server**: having the necessity to do a quicker version of this exercise, I preferred to use it instead of making an entire back-end from scratch.
